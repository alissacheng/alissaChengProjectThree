    <h1>BlackJack Rules</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a friend to play! This is a two player game.</li>
        <li>Decide who gets to be player one and player two. Player one will always go first.</li>
        <li>Each player will get dealt two cards. One is face up and the other is face down.</li>
        <li>Once it is your turn, you will be able to click on your face down card to reveal its value.</li>
        <li>All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand.</li>
        <li>The goal is to get the higher total without going over 21.</li>
        <li>When it is your turn, you can either choose to stay if you are happy with your sum totals by clicking the "Stay" button, or to get another card by clicking "Hit me".</li>
        <li>Each player starts off with $20 in their bank. The amount you start with is your buy in amount. No real money is required for this game.</li> 
        <li>Each round is worth $2. If a player gets Blackjack (an exact sum total of 21), the round is now worth $4.</li>
        <li>There are no splits, double-downs or insurance in this game. (If you don't know what that is, don't worry)</li>
        <li>Click "Next Round" in the top right corner once a winnner or loser is announced to move on to the next round.</li>
        <li>The game is over once a player has no more money in their bank.</li>
    </ol>
